# About

Dreamshop is fake E-commerce website for nighttime shopping. This website was made as a practice for HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Only the frontend has been built somewhat functionally and can be run on GitHub Pages to the best of my abilities.

I apologize for any inconvenience that may arise from visiting the website.

Website styling inspired by ["The Easiest Way to Build Websites" YouTube Video by Sajid](https://youtu.be/OjEg0IBR_ak?si=Dxir2skFV1f17o6I)
